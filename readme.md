# Simple discord bot with OpenAI integration

This is a simple discord bot uses OpenAI to reply to user messages. I put it together in an hour or so to give people a super simple, minimal framework to create discord bots that utilize AI for prototyping simple projects. It is about as lightweight as can be and isn't ready for production use but should give you enough to work with to prototype simple prompts and ideas in a multi-user environment.

You will need to set up a discord developer account and create a bot at http://discord.com/developers/applications.

Once you have done that, you will need to enter your discord bot token in .env

You can create an OpenAI account and API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
